 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz7UWXrV6dE    there is also this thing about the tile sie at about 3:30
 * 
 * 
 *  Debug.Log($"<color=red></color>");      this is for debug checking
 * 
 *  Debug.Log($"<color=orange></color>");      this is for debug checking
 *  
 *  Debug.Log($"<color=yellow></color>");      this is for performance
 *  
 * Debug.Log($"<color=green></color>");      successs
 * 
 * 
 * vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv could vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 * 
 * there can be just a an algo that performs prims
 * using poissons?
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv priority things left vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 * 
 * i have changed it so now the graph view wont be saved if unavailbale issue is that i  need something to change the colour of the node or somthign to indicate which one is the issue but the callback doesnt want to work
 * 
 *doing the room generation with the given algo      random    standard    cell auto
 * 
 * 
 *   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv Things left to implement vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 * 
 *      there is an issue in how the WFC sets the indexes on load
 * 
 *    go into th other pathfinding ones
 *      
 *      
 *    for the return and all the inputs being a bit meh, for the returns instead of doing a specific way do a generalised codpy of the thing similar to how sqauredimaond returns  a list of float in a diff array * 
 *        
 *    
 *    worm/river gen same thing   in the perlinnois.cs
 *    
 *  
 *   
 *   
 *   
 *   
 *   the fact that we need to do the rooms again when deleting them is bad
