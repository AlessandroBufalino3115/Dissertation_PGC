 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz7UWXrV6dE    there is also this thing about the tile sie at about 3:30
 * 
 * 
 *  Debug.Log($"<color=red></color>");      this is for debug checking
 * 
 *  Debug.Log($"<color=orange></color>");      this is for debug checking
 *  
 *  Debug.Log($"<color=yellow></color>");      this is for performance
 *  
 * Debug.Log($"<color=green></color>");      successs
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *   vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv Things left to implement vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 * 
 *  //need to agree on a tile that is cool for every algo
 * 
 *      go into th other pathfinding ones
 *      
 *      look into graph
 *      
 *      for the reutnr and all the inputs being a bit meh, for the returns instead of doing a specific way do a generalised codpy of the thing similar to how sqauredimaond returns  a list of float in a diff array * 
 *    for the walls there is an algo but we need prob marching square      
 *    
 *    worm/river gen same thing   in the perlinnois.cs
 *    
 *    delete rooms that are too small or not needed when made from cellular auto    simialr to how we do the procederal wall thing, flood everything and if its not bigger then a tot delete the whole thing
 *    
 *    we could draw everything instead of being on the cube on a texture which is much better for perf
 *    
 *    standardise this array thigns
 *
